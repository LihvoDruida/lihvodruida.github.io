# Worker functionality overview

This Worker is the server-side integration layer for Mistblossom Vanguard between the public site, GitHub, Discord, the admin dashboard, and Cloudflare KV.

## 1. Guild applications

The Worker accepts applications from the public site through `POST /api/guild-applications` or `POST /`.

### Create flow

1. Validates the request `Origin` against `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
2. Reads a JSON body with an approximate 96 KB limit.
3. Rejects the honeypot field `website` if it is filled.
4. Normalizes application fields:
   - `region`;
   - `characterName`;
   - `faction`;
   - `realm`;
   - `className`;
   - `discord`;
   - `battleTag`;
   - `sourceCreator` / `sourcePlatform` / `sourceOther`;
   - `availability`.
5. Validates required fields:
   - `region`;
   - `characterName`;
   - `faction`;
   - `realm`;
   - `availability`.
6. Requires `battleTag` when faction is `horde`.
7. Creates a GitHub Issue in `GITHUB_OWNER/GITHUB_REPO`.
8. Adds labels:
   - `GUILD_APPLICATIONS_LABEL`, default `guild-application`;
   - `status:review`.
9. Sends a Discord embed to `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` when `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` are configured.
10. Fetches a Raider.IO profile and adds Mythic+ and raid progression fields to the embed.
11. Adds Discord buttons: `Accept` / `Decline`.
12. Stores a Discord message reference in the GitHub Issue body when possible.

### Async Discord notification

By default, Discord notification is executed through `ctx.waitUntil` so the submitter receives a response quickly after the GitHub Issue is created. This is controlled by `APPLICATION_DISCORD_ASYNC`.

- `APPLICATION_DISCORD_ASYNC=1` or unset — Discord notification is queued in the Worker runtime.
- `APPLICATION_DISCORD_ASYNC=0` — the Worker waits for the Discord notification before responding.

## 2. Application listing

`GET /api/guild-applications` and `GET /` read GitHub Issues with label `GUILD_APPLICATIONS_LABEL`.

Supported behavior:

- GitHub page fetching;
- status filters: `review`, `accepted`, `declined`, `all`;
- aliases: `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`;
- class filter;
- text search via `q`;
- sorting by `created` or `updated`;
- direction `asc` or `desc`;
- diagnostics only when debug is explicitly enabled.

The response returns normalized application items: issue number, status, character, realm, region, faction, class, labels, GitHub URL, and dates.

## 3. Application moderation through Discord buttons

Application embeds contain buttons:

- `guild_application:accepted:<issueNumber>`;
- `guild_application:declined:<issueNumber>`.

When a moderator clicks a button, the Worker:

1. Verifies the Discord request signature with `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY`.
2. Checks moderator roles through `DISCORD_ALLOWED_ROLES` if configured.
3. Applies a 2.5 second per-user cooldown.
4. Reads the GitHub Issue.
5. Removes old status labels.
6. Adds `status:accepted` or `status:declined`.
7. Closes the GitHub Issue:
   - accepted → `state_reason: completed`;
   - declined → `state_reason: not_planned`.
8. Adds a GitHub Issue comment with the moderator name.
9. Updates the Discord message color, status, footer, and timestamp.
10. Removes buttons from the public message.

## 4. Discord rules buttons

The Worker supports rules buttons with the `mbv1` prefix.

### Why the confirmation flow exists

Discord cannot hide components on a public message for only one member. The Worker therefore uses this flow:

1. The public embed contains a confirmation button.
2. The user clicks it.
3. The Worker opens a private ephemeral message.
4. The final accept/decline buttons live only in that private message.
5. After the action, the Worker updates only that private message and removes its buttons for that user.

### Rules actions

- Accept rules: the Worker assigns one or more roles through the Discord API.
- Decline rules: the Worker kicks the user from the server.
- Repeated accepts do not duplicate statistics.
- If the user already has all target roles, the Worker says the action is already complete.

### Rules statistics

When the `RULES_STATS` KV binding is configured, the Worker stores:

- `rules:<guildId>:accepted`;
- `rules:<guildId>:declined`;
- `rules:<guildId>:user:<discordId>`;
- `rules:<guildId>:updated_at`.

A single user cannot inflate the counters by clicking repeatedly. If their decision changes, the previous counter is adjusted.

## 5. Raid-rules signup

Raid-rules buttons use the same `/api/discord-interactions` endpoint but a separate KV namespace prefix.

Flow:

1. The user clicks the raid-rules signup button.
2. The Worker opens a confirmation ephemeral panel.
3. After confirmation, the Worker calls the dashboard profile lookup endpoint.
4. The dashboard must confirm that the Discord user is authorized and has a selected main character.
5. If the profile or main character is missing, the Worker returns a private message with buttons for login, profile, raid rules, and optionally the raid page.
6. If verification passes, the Worker writes the signup to KV.

KV keys:

- `raid-rules:<guildId>:user:<discordId>`;
- `raid-rules:<guildId>:updated_at`.

The signup record stores:

- Discord ID;
- Discord label/name;
- dashboard profile id;
- selected main character;
- signup timestamp.

## 6. Raid announcement buttons

The Worker supports custom IDs:

```text
mbv1:raid:<raidId>:going
mbv1:raid:<raidId>:late
mbv1:raid:<raidId>:skipped
```

These buttons do not mutate raid state directly inside the Worker. The Worker proxies the action to the dashboard endpoint:

```text
/api/raids/<raidId>/discord-action
```

or to `DASHBOARD_RAID_ACTION_ENDPOINT` if it is explicitly configured.

The Worker passes to the dashboard:

- action: `going`, `late`, `skipped`;
- Discord user id;
- Discord user label;
- guild id;
- channel id;
- message id;
- source marker `discord-interaction-worker`.

The dashboard returns content/components that the Worker shows to the user as an ephemeral response. If the dashboard reports that authorization or a main character is required, the Worker adds help buttons.

## 7. Relay Discord raid messages

`POST /api/discord-raid-message` lets the dashboard create, edit, or delete Discord raid announcement messages through the Worker.

Supported actions:

- `create`;
- `edit`;
- `delete`.

The endpoint is protected by a bearer/stats token and never enables unrestricted mentions. Role mentions are only allowed through an explicit role ID list.

## 8. Discord channel list

`GET /api/discord-guild-channels` reads the guild and channels through the Discord Bot API.

Only text/news channels are returned:

- `type = 0` — text channel;
- `type = 5` — announcement/news channel.

The Worker also tries to suggest a channel when its name contains `raid`, `рейд`, `анонс`, `announce`, or `оголош`.

## 9. CORS and security

The Worker allows only origins from:

- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`;
- `SITE_BASE_URL`;
- `PUBLIC_SITE_URL`;
- `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_URL`;
- `DASHBOARD_URL`;
- hardcoded fallbacks `https://lihvodruida.pp.ua` and `https://admin.lihvodruida.pp.ua`.

Stats/message endpoints can additionally require a token:

- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`;
- or `X-Worker-Stats-Token: <token>`.

Debug responses through `?debug=1` or `?diag=1` work only when `ALLOW_DEBUG_QUERY=1`. Production should keep `ALLOW_DEBUG_QUERY=0`.

## 10. Observability

The Worker adds telemetry headers:

- `X-Guild-Worker-Request-Id`;
- `X-Guild-Worker-Duration-Ms`.

Logs pass through a sanitizer that redacts tokens, emails and authorization-like fields.
