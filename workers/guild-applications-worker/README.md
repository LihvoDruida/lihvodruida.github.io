# Guild Applications Worker

Cloudflare Worker for **Mistblossom Vanguard** guild applications, GitHub Issue storage, Discord application moderation buttons, Discord rules buttons, raid-rules signups, raid announcement button proxying, and dashboard-facing statistics.

This Worker is designed to sit between:

- the public guild site that submits applications;
- GitHub Issues, used as the application database;
- Discord, used for notifications, moderation buttons, rules buttons, role assignment and raid buttons;
- the admin dashboard, used for profile checks, raid actions and statistics;
- Cloudflare KV, used for rules statistics and raid-rules signup records.

## Quick deployment

```bash
cd workers/guild-applications-worker
npm install -g wrangler
wrangler login
wrangler kv namespace create RULES_STATS
```

Paste the KV namespace id into `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "RULES_STATS"
id = "paste_kv_namespace_id_here"
```

Set production secrets:

```bash
wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN
wrangler secret put DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
wrangler secret put DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY
wrangler secret put DISCORD_GUILD_ID
wrangler secret put INTERNAL_PROFILE_LOOKUP_TOKEN
wrangler secret put DISCORD_RULES_STATS_TOKEN
```

If the admin dashboard is protected by Cloudflare Access, also set:

```bash
wrangler secret put CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID
wrangler secret put CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Deploy:

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

## Required production basics

At minimum, production needs:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO` for GitHub Issues;
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with the public site and admin dashboard origins;
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY`, `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` for Discord bot/interactions;
- `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` if application notifications must be posted to Discord;
- `RULES_STATS` KV binding if rules/raid-rules statistics must work;
- `INTERNAL_PROFILE_LOOKUP_TOKEN` and `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_URL` for raid-rules and raid attendance profile checks;
- `DISCORD_RULES_STATS_TOKEN` shared with the dashboard for protected stats/message endpoints.
